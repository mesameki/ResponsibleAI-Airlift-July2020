## Overview 
This repository contains content of a two-part workshop for using machine learning interpretability and fairness assessment (unfairness mitigation) to build fairer and more transparent models. The different components of the workshop are as follows:

- Part 1: [Interpretability with Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM)](https://github.com/microsoft/ResponsibleAI-Airlift-July2020)
- Part 2: [Explaining Blackbox Models with SHAP](https://github.com/microsoft/ResponsibleAI-Airlift-July2020)
- Part 3: [Fairness Assessment and Unfairness Mitigation with Fairlearn (Bonus: + Interpretability)](https://github.com/microsoft/ResponsibleAI-Airlift-July2020)


## Getting started with the workshop environment

1. Provision your personal Lab environment

    * Open **Registration URL**: http://bit.ly/2OjknZW
    * Enter **Activation Code** which should be provided by the instructors of the workshop.
    * Fill out registration form and Submit it.
    * On the next screen click **Launch Lab**.
    * Wait until your personal environment is provisioned. It should take approximatly 3-5 minutes.

2. Login to Azure ML studio

    * Once the workshop enviroment is ready, you can open new browser tab and navigate to Azure ML studio, using it's direct URL: [https://ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com). We recommend to use Private Browser window for the login to avoid conflicting credentials if you already have Azure subscription.
    * Use credentials provided in the workshop environment to sign-in to Azure ML studio.
    * In the Welcome screen select preprovisioned subcription and workspace similar to screenshot below:

    * Click **Get started**!
    * In the welcome screen click on **Take a quick tour** button to familiarize yourself with Azure ML studio.

3. Create Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM

    * Click on **Compute** tab on the left navigation bar.
    * In the Notebook VM section, click **New**.
    * Enter Notebook VM name of your choice and click **Create**. Creation should take approximately 5 minutes.

4. Clone this repository to Notebook VM in your Azure ML workspace

    * Once Notebook VM is created and in Running state, click on the **Jupyter** link. This will open Jupyter web UI in new browser tab.
    * In Jupyter UI click **New > Terminal**.
    * In terminal window, type and execute command: `ls`
    * Notice the name of your user folder and use that name to execute next command: `cd <userfolder>`
    * Clone the repository of this workshop by executing following command: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/responsibleai-airlift-july2020.git`

5. Open Part 1 of the workshop

    * Go back to the Jupyter window.
    * Open `EBM.ipynb` notebook.

You are ready to start your workshop! Have fun.
